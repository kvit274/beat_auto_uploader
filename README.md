THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN PROGRESS...


Beat Auto Uploader is an end-to-end automation tool for music producers that uploads beats to BeatStars and YouTube with minimal manual input.

The system automatically selects a beat and artwork, detects BPM and key, fetches trending tags, generates optimized metadata using AI, creates a YouTube-ready video, uploads the track to BeatStars, publishes the video to YouTube (with scheduling support), and cleans up files afterward.

Built in Python using Playwright, FFmpeg, YouTube Data API, and Gemini, it’s designed to fully automate the beat release workflow while respecting platform limits and best practices.
